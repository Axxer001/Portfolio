        <div class="two">
            <span class="val">
                <p>I am very passionate about learning and sharing knowledge. It is very
                    much fascinating to increase one's area of knowing, improving one's skill,
                    and developing new interests.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    There are certain principles that people strongly believe and or disagree with, 
                    and that's how the people are divided within this world. Their morals also differ
                    in a huge margin because of it, causing humanity from ever obtaining peace. And so, 
                    I consider myself morally gray. Too many sides to take, and neither of them aren't flawed.
                    Much better if decisions are made with proper reason and logic in mind.

        <h2 id="three">My Approach and Process</h2>
        <div class="three">
            <span class="app">
                <p>I develop my approach with as simple as learning, then adapting. It doesn't just involve
                    the idea of knowing what you are going to do, but also considering the area that it possesses,
                    as well as its limitations.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Then consider all of those rules to develop an accurate process that avoids flawed possibilities,
                    considering only the steps that are highly relevant, to keep up within the context of the problem.
                    Making this accurate solution limits the thought to stay in place, which devoids creativity from the 
                    work. Thus. after the main process, I look for other possibilities in solving problems that involves
                    outside thinking.
